# statistics

I create this repo for my statistics projects, at University of Pisa.

I performed 3 statistics task, using R.

1) In the firt project I compute a regression to predict the price of a house using R; you can find more detail, reading the progetto.pdf file, that describe every step computed in this analysis.
Moreover you can download dataset tabella.csv and try to replicate the analysis, writing r-instructions you can find on script.r file.

2) In the second project I select a dataset regarding some post on Facebook and I compute some clustering algorithm, to find some similar groups.

3) In the last project I select a dataset related to some Uber rides on 2014. After some preprocessing using TestScanner.java code, I analyze data as timeseries, trying to predict the number of future. rides
